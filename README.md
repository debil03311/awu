# aw/u/
A terminal client for [danger/u/](https://dangeru.us/)


## Installation
You're going to need `requests`, `argparse` and `colored` to get this to work properly.

$ git clone https://github.com/isvinc3s/awu.git
$ cd awu
$ python3 awu.py
```
If you want to run it as a regular command:

$ sudo cp ./awu.py /usr/local/bin/awu
```
